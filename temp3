Aşağıda metni tamamen profesyonel, TMD’ye uygun, mevcut açıklama stiline birebir uyumlu ve senin eklemek istediğin tüm noktalara göre güçlendirilmiş şekilde yeniden yazdım.

Üç yeni unsur entegre edildi:
	1.	Fuzzy matching kullanımının zorunlu olması, çünkü dokümanlar tamamen standardize değil.
	2.	Tam LLM kullanımının proje kapsamında önerilmemesi, bu nedenle performansın doğal olarak sınırlanması.
	3.	PaddleOCR ve LLM entegrasyonu yapılabilseydi okunabilir tablo sayısının somut olarak artacağı (53 + 23 + full LLM ile çok daha yüksek).

Additional Model Weaknesses & Limitations (Revised for TMD)

• Limitations in Table Extraction Due to Incomplete PaddleOCR Integration

Although PaddleOCR provides advanced table structure recognition capabilities, the full integration of PaddleOCR’s table parser could not be completed within the project timeline. As a result, the system currently relies on line-based heuristic detection rather than a deep-learning–based table extraction engine.

This fallback approach functions adequately but remains inherently sensitive to a variety of document quality issues such as:
	•	broken or uneven table lines,
	•	irregular row spacing,
	•	OCR-induced visual noise,
	•	low-resolution or skewed TIFF scans.

Based on test results, it is estimated that up to 53 additional tables could have been successfully extracted if PaddleOCR’s table extraction module had been fully integrated. A more advanced structural parser (e.g., PaddleOCR Structure, DocTR, LayoutLMv3) would substantially reduce reliance on heuristics and significantly improve downstream accuracy.

• Limited Correction Accuracy in OCR Outputs Due to LLM + Fuzzy Matching Constraints

To compensate for OCR errors—particularly in noisy TIFF documents—a hybrid correction layer combining LLM reasoning with fuzzy string matching was implemented. However, this method carries fundamental limitations:
	1.	Fuzzy matching does not provide semantic reliability when character distortions are severe.
	2.	LLM-based correction remains dependent on OCR quality; highly noisy outputs lead to inconsistent reconstructions.
	3.	Fuzzy similarity scores may unintentionally match incorrect labels.
	4.	Even with correction, table structures broken during OCR cannot always be restored.

Despite these challenges, the hybrid approach generated a clear improvement over raw OCR. Without this additional layer, a substantial portion of documents would not be readable at all.

• Constraints Due to Document Non-Standardization and the Need for Fuzzy Matching

The document population is not standardized—layout, wording, table order, and even field naming vary significantly across branches and time periods.
Because of this inconsistency:
	•	fuzzy matching became mandatory, not optional;
	•	deterministic or rule-only mapping strategies were insufficient;
	•	performance ceiling was inherently limited by the variability of the input population.

In stable, standardized document environments, fuzzy would be supplementary; here, it was a structural necessity.

• Restrictions on Full LLM Utilization and Its Impact on Performance

Business and architectural constraints prevented the use of full end-to-end LLM-based parsing for table extraction, header detection, or cell normalization.
LLM usage was intentionally restricted to lightweight correction tasks to avoid:
	•	latency issues,
	•	operational cost increase,
	•	uncontrolled hallucination risks,
	•	dependency on unstable generative outputs.

If LLM could have been applied to reconstruct table headers and normalize row structures, an additional 23 tables could likely have been recovered.

Furthermore, if a fully LLM-driven extraction pipeline had been allowed, overall readability would be expected to increase significantly, particularly for degraded TIFF documents.
