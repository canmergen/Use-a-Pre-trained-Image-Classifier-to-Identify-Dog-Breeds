Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three models reported the same classification.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ResNet and VGG couldn't identify some of them. AlexNet also classified the flipped image as a weimaraner consistenly. Between them ResNet and VGG are better than AlexNet for this dataset.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, they are classified correctly.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: As all models stated the same classification and they classified nearly the same I will select the most efficient one. So, AlexNet leaves out from the relation. Between ResNet and VGG I would choose VGG because it has slightly better guess about the breeds than the other one.
